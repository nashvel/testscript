## Usage

### GUI Version (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the GUI application
python3 git_commit_gui.py
```

#### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Select Repository Directory**
   - Click "Browse" and select your local Git repository
   - Or enter the path manually
   - If the directory isn't a Git repository, one will be initialized

2. **GitHub Integration (Optional)**
   - Enter your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`)
   - Enter your GitHub username
   - Paste your GitHub personal access token

3. **Configure Commits**
   - Use the dropdown to select the number of commits to generate (1-100)
   - Each commit will have a unique timestamp and message

4. **Generate Commits**
   - Click "Start" to begin generating commits
   - Monitor progress in the log area
   - The progress bar shows overall completion
   - Detailed status messages appear below the progress bar

5. **Pushing to GitHub**
   - If GitHub URL is provided, commits will be automatically pushed
   - The app will verify your access and create the repository if needed
   - You'll be prompted before creating a new repository
### Command Line Version

For advanced users, a command-line version is available:

```bash
python3 mass_commits.py --repo /path/to/repo --count 10 --github-url https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### GUI Features

1. **Automatic Credential Saving**
   - Your GitHub credentials are saved automatically (securely in your home directory)
   - No need to re-enter your token and username each time

2. **Repository Management**
   - Initialize new Git repositories with one click
   - Connect to existing repositories easily
   - Automatic remote repository configuration

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Detailed log of all operations
   - Clear status messages

4. **User Experience**
   - Clean, modern interface
   - Responsive design
   - Error handling with helpful messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - Ensure your GitHub token has the `repo` scope
   - Verify you have write access to the repository

2. **Repository Not Found**
   - Check the repository URL is correct
   - Ensure the repository exists and is not private (unless using a token with private repo access)

3. **Authentication Failures**
   - Generate a new token if the current one is expired
   - Make sure to copy the entire token correctly

4. **Push Rejected**
   - Try enabling the "Force Push" option if you're working with an existing repository
   - Make sure you have the latest changes before pushing

## Security Notes

- Your GitHub token is only used during the push operation and is not stored
- For better security, consider using SSH authentication
- Never commit your token to version control
